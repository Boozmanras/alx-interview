# Pascal's Triangle

This project is part of the ALX interview preparation curriculum. It focuses on implementing a function to generate Pascal's Triangle.

## Project Description

The main task is to create a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascal's triangle of `n`.

## Function Specification

### `pascal_triangle(n)`

- Returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal's triangle of `n`.
- Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.
- Assumes `n` will always be an integer.

## File Structure

- `0-pascal_triangle.py`: Contains the implementation of the `pascal_triangle` function.
- `0-main.py`: A main file to test the `pascal_triangle` function.

## Usage

To run the program:

1. Ensure both `0-pascal_triangle.py` and `0-main.py` are in the same directory.
2. Run the following command:
./0-main.py
