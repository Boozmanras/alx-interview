# Minimum Operations

This project contains a Python script that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in a file, given that only two operations are allowed: Copy All and Paste.

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Python 3.4.3
* PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)

## File Description

* `0-minoperations.py`: Contains the `minOperations(n)` function that calculates the minimum number of operations.

## Usage

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
```

## Function Description

```python
def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters.

    Args:
        n (int): The desired number of H characters.

    Returns:
        int: The minimum number of operations needed, or 0 if n is impossible to achieve.
    """
```

## Example

```
$ ./0-main.py
Min number of operations to reach 4 characters: 4
Min number of operations to reach 12 characters: 7
```
